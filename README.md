# Example Apps

Welcome to the [Tatum Example Apps](https://tatum.io/dapp-templates) repository, containing a collection of simple example applications that demonstrate the usage of the [Tatum SDK](https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js) for various blockchain and cryptocurrency operations!

## Examples

Here's a list of example applications available in this repository:

- [**Metamask Transfer**](Metamask/transfer): Connect your wallet and perform a quick transfer of funds

- [**Metamask Portfolio**](Metamask/portfolio): Connect your wallet and get all balances

- [**Metamask Notifications**](Metamask/notifications): Connect your wallet and keep track of your transactions

- _[**BTC RPC**](YT%20Apps/BTC%20RPC): Possibly outdated, but can still be used as a reference for the simplest way to use the SDK_

## Getting Started
